    <h3> Control explanation : </h3>
    <p> You can place at most 100 points. When all of your points of the polygon are placed, you can press "enter". Then, you can place the last point then a message wil appear saying if this point is inside or not.  </p>

     <p>There are 2 modes(switchable with space) : point in a polygon(0 by default) with the algorithm counting crossings in O(n). The second mode(1) is determining if a point is in a convex polygon given in counter clockwise order by binary search in O(log(n)).</p>
