    <h3> Control explanation : </h3>
    <p> You can place points(max 100) to form a polygon given in counter clockwise order. When all of your points are placed, you can press "enter" to display the triangulation. Then, you can begin another drawing by cliking on the "drawing surface" to place the first point of a new polygon. </p>
