    <p> Control explanation : </p>
    <p>There are 3 modes : orientation determinant(0), point in a triangle(1)  and cyclic points ordering. You can switch from one to the next in circular order by pressing enter. Each mode use the same display surface.


    <ol>
      <li>Orientation determinant :  You have to place 3 points. After that, the orientation is printed in the console. </li>
      <li>Point in a triangle :  You have to place 4 points. the first three points form a triangle and the last is a point. After that, a message, indicating if the point is in the triangle or not, is printed in the console. </li>
      <li>Cyclic points ordering : You have to place between one and 25 points. When nearly all the points that you need are placed, you have to pressed space and then place your last point that can be the ith with i<=25. The first point is the center. An algorithm will order the points in clockwise order an draw line between the points from the first to the second then from the second to the third and so on. The first point is marked in red.</li> 
    </ol>
    Once you finished your drawing, you can begin another one by clicking on the display surface to place the first point of your new drawing.
